# Pokemon Gym

## https://mewtwo2.github.io/pokemon-gym/

This is a group project that was made in a day.

The idea is that there are three trainers in a gym and each trainer has three pokemon.

When you click on a trainer, you are able to click on the individual pokeballs under the trainer and see their pokemon.

When you hover over the colored sections that pop up, you will see the stats of each individual pokemon.
